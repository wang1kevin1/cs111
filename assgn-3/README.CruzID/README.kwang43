Team: W's Only

Kevin Wang (kwang43)
Malcolm Neill (mneill)
Nicolette Miller (nmiller2)
Edmund Yu (eyu9)

My contribution: I contributed to the design doc and benchmark as well as its analysis. I assisted with all parts concerning the Bon Chance (not statistic printing).
I helped merge everything together and bug fixed so everything compiled.

My team is the best team. Everyone does their work and on time.
