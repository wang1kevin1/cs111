# Design Overview 

## Todo MAKE SURE TO ADD DESIGN DOC STUFF WHILE YOUâ€™RE CODING YOUR PART
* Benchmark script + dmesg/log output (EY)
* Shell script and ifndef for switching cases/loading kernel mode (kw)
* Splatter scheduler (random generator w/data structures) (MN)
* Priority queue (priority queue, use heap or linked-list and why?) (Nikki)

## Splatter Scheduler

### Case 1: ULE scheduler and FIFO queues.

Base implementation of the FreeBSD system. No changes needed. Note that the original code must be preserved and any changes will require if/else/switch boolean checks.

### Case 2: ULE scheduler with priority queues.

User threads are assigned to queues based on priority. Manipulation function, see TAILQ.

### Case 3: Splatter scheduler and FIFO queues.

User process threads given a random value and added to a FIFO queue based on lottery.
(how to do random? - built in w/freebsd or separate alg?)

### Case 4: Splatter scheduler and priority queues.

User process threads are assigned a random priority value and added to a priority queue.

### Switching Cases
In order to be able to easily implement all four cases, we will add a global value ```sched_case``` to sched_ule.c. This static int value can be updated using the FreeBSD sysctl(9). To allow easy switching, we can specify which scheduling case we want while the kernel is loaded.

## Kernel Modifications

### Data 
make sure to add lines of code (can be pseudo) added/changed and description of why and what it does.

**sched_ule.c**
```
static int schedcase	// used to determine which kernel case is being used
```
